## Check salt keys
This script is used to check a list of salt keys to if they are accepted, denied, unaccepted, or rejected.

This can be useful when checking that a new batch of devices have all been accepted to salt.

To use the script just make a `salt-keys` file in the same directory and run the script with `./check-salt-keys.py`
